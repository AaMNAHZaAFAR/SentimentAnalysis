# SentimentAnalysis
Sentiment analysis is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative, and neutral) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows businesses to identify customer sentiment toward products, brands, or services in online conversations and feedback.
Well, that all sounds great. But how exactly do we intend to do it? The answer lies with something which has caught our attention for quite some time. Machine Learning.
Implemented a BERT model to perform sentiment analysis on airline reviews. The project involved collecting a dataset of airline reviews containing positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. The data was preprocessed to clean the text and prepare it for the BERT tokenizer. The pre-trained BERT model was then fine-tuned on this dataset to adapt it to the specific context of airline feedback. The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness in accurately classifying sentiments in the reviews.
